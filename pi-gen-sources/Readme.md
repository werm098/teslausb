### Building a teslausb image

To build a ready to flash one-step setup image for CIFS, do the following:

1. Clone pi-gen from https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen
2. Follow the instructions in the pi-gen readme to install the required dependencies
3. In the pi-gen folder, run:
   ```
   echo 'IMG_NAME=teslausb' > config
   echo 'HOSTNAME=teslausb' >> config
   echo 'STAGE_LIST="stage0 stage1 stage2 stage_teslausb"' >> config
   rm -rf stage2/EXPORT_NOOBS stage2/EXPORT_IMAGE
   mkdir stage_teslausb
   touch stage_teslausb/EXPORT_IMAGE
   cp stage2/prerun.sh stage_teslausb/prerun.sh
   ```
4. Copy teslausb/pi-gen-sources/00-teslausb-tweaks to the pi-gen/stage_teslausb folder
5. Adjust `DATA_SIZE` in scripts/qcow2_handling to have more free space on the root partition. For the prebuilt image, it was hardcoded to 2 GB by inserting `let DATA_SIZE=2*1024*1024*1024/$BLOCK_SIZE` before the call to `resize2fs -p`.
6. Run `build.sh` or `build-docker.sh`, depending on how you configured pi-gen to build the image
7. Sit back and relax, this could take a while (for reference, on a dual-core 2.6 Ghz Intel Core i3 and 50 Mbps internet connection, it took under an hour)
   If all went well, the image will be in the `deploy` folder. Use Raspberry Pi Imager or a similar tool to flash it.
