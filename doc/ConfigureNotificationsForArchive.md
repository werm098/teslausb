OPTIONAL: You can choose to integrate with [Pushover](https://pushover.net), [Gotify](https://gotify.net/), [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com), [Telegram](https://telegram.org), [AWS SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/), and/or [Discord](https://discord.com/) to get a push/email notification to your phone when the copy process is done. Depending on your wireless network speed/connection, copying files may take some time, so a push notification can help confirm that the process finished. If no files were copied (i.e. all manually saved dashcam files were already copied, no notification will be sent.).

# Pushover

The Pushover service is free for up to 7,500 messages per month, but the [iOS](https://pushover.net/clients/ios)/[Android](https://pushover.net/clients/android) apps do have a one time cost, after a free trial period. _This also assumes your Pi is connected to a network with internet access._

1. Create a free account at Pushover.net, and install and log into the mobile Pushover app.
2. On the Pushover dashboard on the web, copy your **User key**.
3. [Create a new Application](https://pushover.net/apps/build) at Pushover.net. The description and icon don't matter, choose what you prefer.
4. Copy the **Application Key** for the application you just created. The User key + Application Key are basically a username/password combination to needed to send the push.
5. Run these commands, substituting your user key and app key in the appropriate places. No `"` are needed.

   export PUSHOVER_ENABLED=true
   export PUSHOVER_USER_KEY=put_your_userkey_here
